## Abstract
Based on the key idea of DETR this paper introduces an object-centric 3D object detection framework that operates on a limited number of 3D object queries instead of dense bounding box proposals followed by non-maximum suppression. After image feature extraction a decoder-only transformer architecture is trained on a set-based loss. SpatialDETR infers the classification and bounding box estimates based on attention both spatially within each image and across the different views. To fuse the multi-view information in the attention block we introduce a novel geometric positional encoding that incorporates the view ray geometry to explicitly consider the extrinsic and intrinsic camera setup. This way, the  spatially-aware cross-view attention exploits arbitrary receptive fields to integrate cross-sensor data and therefore global context. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate the potential of global attention and result in state-of-the-art performance.

## Setup
To setup the repository and run trainings we refer to [getting_started.md](getting_started.md)

## Changelog
### 06/22
- We moved the codebase to the new coordinate conventions of `mmdetection3d rc1.0ff`
- The performance might slightly vary compared to the original runs on `mmdetection3d 0.17` reported in the paper


## Experimental results
The baseline models have been trained on `4xV100 GPUs`, the submission models on `8xA100 GPUs`. For more details we refer to the corresponding configuration / log files. Keep in mind that the performance can vary between runs and that the current codebase uses `mmdetection3d@rc1.0`
